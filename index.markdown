# Peter Boddy PhD.

Peter is a researcher in the cognitive neuroscience of language.
He wrote his PhD thesis on the the representation of conceptual information in the brain.

He is interested in sensorimotor/embodied accounts of semantics and conceptual dynamics, i.e., how context, whether the environment you are in, the activities you are multitasking or the idiosyncrasies of your previous experiences, affects how you think about objects.

He is interested in olfaction & vision in semantic memory and the interference/facilitation of conceptual retrieval/task performance during on-line multitask processing.

Another line of investigation Peter has surrounds Parkinsonâ€™s Disease and its impact on the representation of manipulable objects and the relationship between L-dopa and impulse control disorders.

Recently, Peter has been studying spatial language, deictic communication and interactive alignment.
