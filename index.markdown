# Peter Boddy PhD.

I am a researcher in the cognitive neuroscience and psychology of language and memory.

My most recent research post was as a Senior Research Associate at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich (UK) where I worked on spatial perspective taking and spatial language with [Prof. Kenny Coventry](https://www.kennycoventry.org).

My doctoral training was in the cognitive neuroscience of language at the Basque Center on Cognition Brain and Language [(BCBL)](https://www.bcbl.eu/es) and the University of the Basque Country [EHU/UPV](https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/doktoregoak/doctorate-linguistics/competencies) in San Sebastian, Spain. I was supervised by [Dr Eiling Yee](https://yeelab.uconn.edu/people/) (UConn) and [Dr Kepa Paz-Alonso](https://www.bcbl.eu/en/conocenos/equipo/pedro-m-kepa-paz-alonso) (BCBL). I wrote my [PhD thesis](./PeterBoddy_PhDThesis_2020.pdf) on the the representation of conceptual information in the brain.

I am interested in understanding how memory works in humans. To this end I design experiments and collect behavioural and fMRI data.

In general I am interested in sensorimotor/embodied accounts of semantics and conceptual dynamics, i.e., how context, whether the environment you are in, the activities you are multitasking or the idiosyncrasies of your previous experiences, affects how you think about objects.

I have specialised in the study of olfaction & vision in semantic memory and the interference/facilitation of conceptual retrieval/task performance during on-line multitask processing.

Another line of investigation I am involved in relates to Parkinsonâ€™s Disease and its impact on the representation of manipulable objects and the relationship between L-dopa and impulse control disorders.

I am from Norwich (UK) and live in San Sebastian (Basque Country, Spain).

***As of January 2021 I am actively looking for new work opportunities.***
